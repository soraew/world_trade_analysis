\section*{Abstract}
The US-China trade war since 2018 has had a major impact on the world economy. 
However, most research on this topic has focused on the magnitude of the effect
and not much on it's characteristic and how the relationship between countries
has changed.
I employ a complex network approach for the timeframe 2017-2019 to study the 
change in characteristic of the world trade network of one of the product 
categories (Telecommunication equipment) that had the most impact due to 
tariffs in the early years of the trade war.
I find that the communities in the world trade network has followed a pattern 
similar to the communities in the world RTA network.
Suggesting that in times of shock, the way in which countries connect to each 
other differ from when there aren't major shocks in the network.
I also show that the relationship between countries within the same community 
has changed, mainly the rise in Vietnam's network power.
