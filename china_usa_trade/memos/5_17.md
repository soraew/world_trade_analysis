# todo
- [x] get China and USA's export/imports before trade war and after trade war
    - tariffs were introduced in January 2018
	
## method
- use split, cat and grep to create csv quickly
	- command:
```shell
split -l 100000000 ../../../../data/trade/US_TradeMatrix_5csv.csv
```
- create file to save filtered data
```shell 
touch 6_1_china_us_filtered.csv
```
- filter
```shell
cat xaa | grep United\ States\ of\ America | grep China | grep -wv Developing\ economies\ excluding\ China | grep -wv China,\ Taiwan\ Province\ of >> 6_1_china_us_filtered.csv
```

new columns = ```year,economy,economy_label,partner,partner_label,flow,flow_label,product,product_label,KUSD,KUSD_footnote```

- new label:'Old Label'
    - year:'Year', 
      economy:'Economy', 
      economy_label:'Economy Label', 
      partner:'Partner', 
      partner_label:'Partner Label', 
      flow:'Flow', 
      flow_label:'Flow Label', 
      product:'SitcRev3Product', 
      product_label:'SitcRev3Product Label', 
      KUSD:'US dollars at current prices in thousands', 
      KUSD_footnote:'US dollars at current prices in thousands Footnote'
	  
```bash
awk -F ',' '{if($3 = "China"|$3 = "United States of America") sum[$1","$3","$5","$7]+=10} END {for (key in sum) print key","sum[key]}' csvs/6_6_xaa_filtered.csv
```


## mysql approach
(done)
```sql
create table baci_xaa(year INT(15), economy INT(15), economy_label VARCHAR(150), partner VARCHAR(15), partner_label VARCHAR(100), flow INT(5), flow_label VARCHAR(10), product INT(15), product_label VARCHAR(100), KUSD FLOAT(25), KUSD_footnote FLOAT(10)); 
```
(done)
```sql
set global local_infile=ON;
```
(done)
```sql
load data local infile '/private/tmp/xaa' into table baci_xaa fields terminated by ',' enclosed by '"' lines terminated by '\n' ignore 1 rows;
```
(this not working tho)
```sql?
with cte as (select sum(KUSD) as sum_total from baci_xaa)
select product, product_label, sum(KUSD)/cte.sum_total as product_ratio
from baci_xaa
where year = 2016
group by product, product_label
order by product_ratio
```
(done)
```sql
select 'product', 'product_label', 'sum_kusd'
union all
select product, product_label, sum(KUSD) as sum_kusd
from baci_xaa
where year = 2016
group by product, product_label
into outfile '/private/tmp/tradewar_tmp/RCA.csv'
fields terminated by ','
enclosed by '"'
lines terminated by '\n'
;
```
