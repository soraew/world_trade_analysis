4. **Subsidies:**
    - Financial support or incentives provided to domestic industries to promote production, exports, or competitiveness.

6. **Countervailing Duties:**
    - Additional tariffs imposed on imports to offset the effects of subsidies provided to foreign producers.

7. **Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT):**
    - Regulations and standards related to product quality, safety, labeling, and packaging, which can act as trade barriers if used unjustifiably or excessively.

    - Regulations that govern foreign investment in domestic industries, including restrictions, incentives, and ownership limits.

12. **Licensing and Certification:**
    - Requirements for obtaining licenses or certifications to engage in specific trade activities or comply with certain regulations.

13. **Exchange Rate Policies:**
    - Government interventions or management of currency exchange rates, which can impact the competitiveness of exports and imports.

14. **Trade Remedies:**
    - Measures such as safeguard measures or voluntary export restraints to protect domestic industries from sudden surges in imports.

15. **Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs):**
    - Bilateral or multilateral agreements that provide preferential treatment, such as reduced tariffs or increased market access, to member countries.

These regulatory tools are used by governments to shape and manage their international trade relationships, protect domestic industries, ensure safety and quality standards, and pursue various economic and policy objectives. The specific tools employed can vary depending on national policies, international agreements, and the prevailing trade environment.
